# 40pin Board with full silkscreen
## Board features
This board is based on the AGB-CPU-02 revision and features the full silkscreen.
There are no mods added to the board so it's a direct replacement to an original board with the same features.
It has the same test points as the original board and is compatible with the mods that are available for the original board.

## BOM
The BOM for this board will be available once the parts are confirmed to be correct. The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.
