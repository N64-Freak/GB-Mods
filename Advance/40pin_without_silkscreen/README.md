# 40pin Board without silkscreen
## Board features
This board is based on the AGB-CPU-02 revision and does not have the full silkscreen.
The silkscreen does only have some design elements printed but is missing all the component designators.
There are no mods added to the board so it's a direct replacement to an original board with the same features.
It has the same test points as the original board and is compatible with the mods that are available for the original board.

## BOM
As this board does not have any component designators there will not be a BOM available.
For anyone who wants to torture himself the board is identical to the 40pin board with the silkscreen so you can order the parts and look for the component designators on the 40pin board with silkscreen

->Recommended is to move over all the parts one by one from a suitable donor console.

## Example of an assembled board
As i don't have an assembled board of this revision the images of unpopulated boards have to be enough for now. Will be replaced once i assembled another one!

## Additional information
One of the footprints is missing 2 pads. These 2 pads aren't used on the Layout and are not connected on the original Layout.
On most gameboys the part that is installed does not have this 2 extra pins but some consoles use a different part that has the 2 extra legs.
In case your donor has the component with the extra 2 legs it would have 2 pins floating like this. This is only an optical imperfection and will be fixed with the next board revision!

As i currently have no assembled board of this version i had to borrow the image from the 32pin board. Except for the silkscreen the layout in this part of the board is the same.
