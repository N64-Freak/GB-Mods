# 32pin Board with full silkscreen
## Board features
This board is based on the AGB-CPU-10 revision and features the full silkscreen.
There are no mods added to the board so it's a direct replacement to an original board with the same features.
It has the same test points as the original board and is compatible with the mods that are available for the original board.

## BOM
The BOM for this board will be available once the parts are confirmed to be correct. The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

## Example of an assembled board
More images can be found in the images folder.

## Additional information
One of the footprints is missing 2 pads. These 2 pads aren't used on the Layout and are not connected on the original Layout.
On most gameboys the part that is installed does not have this 2 extra pins but some consoles use a different part that has the 2 extra legs.
In case your donor has the component with the extra 2 legs it would have 2 pins floating like this. This is only an optical imperfection and will be fixed with the next board revision!
