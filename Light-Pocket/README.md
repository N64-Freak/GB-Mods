# Gameboy Light-Pocket

## About this board
The Gamboy Light-Pocket is a mod board which basically is a Gameboy Pocket in the shell of a Gameboy Light.
This mod is perfect for you if you like the gameboy pocket but want better battery life because your backlight and flashcard suck down the batteries too fast.
I designed this board so it only uses parts that Nintendo used in this time period. It is compatible with the original Gameboy Pocket Screen or IPS screens.

There is cutting and rewiring involved in building a Gameboy Light-Pocket!
The board just fits in a Gameboy Light Shell and feels like an officially released model.
To install the screen either an IPS mod with an IPS ready shell or some modification on the shell are required as for any IPS mod.
For the original screen there are modifications on the shell required. 

The BOM is available and is pretty much identical to the BOM for the Gameboy Color.

## The Screen
The pcb is designed so you can keeep using the original gameboy pocket screen and add an LED backlight to it but still have good battery life.  
If you want to add an LED backlight the rear polarizer has to be replaced on the screen. The LED mod kits do include a suitable replacement polarizer.
Just be aware that additional modifications to the screen are required if you want to use an LED backlight!

You can also use a gameboy pocket Q5 ips mod if you like the image quality better or your original screen is defective.
The install for the IPS mod does require cutting the Shell as the Gameboy light shells aren't ips ready!

## BOM
The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.
There is only 1 additional component that has to be added compared to a gameboy pocket.

The BOM can be found in the "BOM" folder or following the below link:
