# Original Gameboy

## Different board versions
The Original Gameboy had 8 Different Board revisions. 
The Revisions starting from DMG-CPU-01 up to DMG-CPU-06 are supported by my replacement boards as they are using discrete components.
The Board revisions DMG-CPU-07 and DMG-CPU-08 are using blob type components that cannot be transfered over to the new boards.
But these board revisions can still be used as donors for the peripheral parts like the cartridge connector, power switch, audio jack and so on.

This board and the BOM are based around the DMG-CPU-06 revision of the DMG motherboard but it should be the same parts across all the board revisions.

## BOM

The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

The BOM can be found in the "BOM" folder or following the below link:

[Gameboy DMG BOM](/DMG/BOM/BOM_DMG.xlsx)

## Example of an assembled board
More images can be found in the images folder.

## Additional information

On the original Layout of the DMG 4 pads of the CPU's footprint have been modeled slightly smaller as the mounting tabs of the LCD connector were interfering and needed some space for the holes.
On my Layout i kept the original size of the pads and left out the mounting holes therefore the mounting tabs on the LCD connector need to be removed so the LCD connector sits flat.

As i did a small mistake while ordering the boards some component values are missing on the silkscreen.
But the more important component designators are all present. This will be fixed with the next board revision.
