# Gameboy Pocket-Color

## About this board
The Gamboy Pocket-Color is a mod board which basically is a Gameboy color in the shell of a Gameboy Pocket.
I designed this board so it only uses parts that Nintendo used in this time period. It is compatible with the original Gameboy Color Screen or IPS screens.

There no longer is curring and rewiring involved in building a Gameboy Pocket-Color!
The board just fits in a Gameboy Pocket Shell and feels like an officially released model.
To install the screen either an IPS mod with an IPS ready shell or some modification on the shell are required as for any IPS mod.

The BOM is available and is pretty much identical to the BOM for the Gameboy Color.

## The Screen
The pcb is designed so you can keeep using the original gameboy color screen but for the best result an IPS mod is prefered.
The screen i am personally using is an unbranded Q5 ips mod.
**Caution:** Do **NOT** use a laminated Q5 ips mod and also don't use a Q5 ips kit with the light up logo.
The kits with the light up logo don't offer enough Y-position adjustment for the image!

## BOM
The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

The BOM can be found in the "BOM" folder or following the below link:

[Gameboy Pocket-Color BOM](/Pocket-Color/BOM/BOM_MGBC.xlsx)
