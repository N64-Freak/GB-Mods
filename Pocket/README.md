# Gameboy Pocket

## Different board versions
The Gamboy Pocket had 2 different board revision. 
The earlier boards had no power LED while the later revisions had the power LED added. Technically the boards are identical except the missing power LED on the earlier boards.
Because of the mising power LED the 2 board revisions aren't interchangeable as there are some small changes in the shell design. 
You should consider this when you try to swap boards around with a few gameboy pockets.

Currently only the later revision with the power LED is available as a replacement part!

## BOM

The BOM for this board will be available once the parts are confirmed to be correct. The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

*BOM will be available once parts are verified*
