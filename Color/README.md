## Different board versions
The Gamboy Color had 6 different board revision. 
The board revisions CGB-CPU-01 up to CGB-CPU-05 did only have minor differeces. Only the CGB-CPU-06 board introduced a bigger change by having the RAM integrated into the CPU.
The replacement board is based on the CGB-CPU-04 revision but the BOM should cover the other board revisions too.

## BOM
The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

The BOM can be found in the "BOM" folder or following the below link:
