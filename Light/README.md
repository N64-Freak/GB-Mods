# Gameboy Light

![](/Light/Images/IMG_9697.jpg)

## Different board versions
The Gameboy Light only had 1 motherboard revision.
As the Gameboy light was only released in japan for a relatively short period of time anyone outside of japan didn't get a chance to buy it.
Therefore it's a pretty thought after console for collectors nowadays.

This board and the BOM are therefore based around the MGL-CPU-01 revision of the motherboard.

## BOM

The BOM for this board will be available once the parts are confirmed to be correct. The BOM and the mentioned component values and part names are identical to the retail boards and can also be used to buy spare parts for your stock gameboy board.

*BOM will be available once parts are verified*

## Example of an assembled board
